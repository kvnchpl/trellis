# Trellis

**Trellis** is a relaxing farming simulation game where you manage your own farm, plant crops, and care for the land.

## Gameplay Overview

In Trellis, you control a player who can move around a grid-based farm map. Each tile can represent soil, tilled land, grass, or rock, and may contain plants at different growth stages.

### Player Actions
You can perform various actions on tiles, depending on their current state:
